<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><h1>Passionate about technology and naturally curious, I've just started my journey into the world of programming. Every line of code is a new challenge, a puzzle to solve, and an opportunity to build something innovative. Even though I’m a beginner, I enjoy exploring new languages, experimenting with hands-on projects, and improving day by day. My goal? To keep getting better, understand the ‘behind the scenes’ of software, and maybe create something useful and original.</h1></p>
